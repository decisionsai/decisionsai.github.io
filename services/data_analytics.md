Data is ubiquitous and your business would be hard pressed if not using analytics in making informed business decisions and measure performance. 
Successful implimentation of data analytics and decision making makes a big impact on bottom line, with businesses who utilise big data increasing their profits by an average of 8-10%. The four types of data analysis should be used in tandem to create a full picture of the story data tells and make informed decisions. As a team of data experts, we gurantee meaningful managerial insights to help business grow. Data can help your business in following 4 ways: 

**Our expertise includes:**

1. **Descriptive Analytics** : “What happened?” - Did my sales increase? When machine break-down? How many order did we fullfill?
   Descriptive analytics involves summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way to gain insights into patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Descriptive     analytics often includes techniques such as data visualization, summary statistics, and exploratory data analysis to help understand the characteristics and properties of    the data.
   
2. **Diagnostic Analytics** : “Why did this happen?” - What factors contributed to a decrease in sales last quarter? Why are customers abandoning their online shopping carts? What are the reasons behind a spike in customer complaints?
Diagnostic Analytics includes comparing coexisting trends or movement, uncovering correlations between variables, and determining causal relationships where possible.

3. **Predictive Analytics** : “What might happen in the future?” - What is the likelihood of a customer making a purchase in the next month? How will changes in market conditions affect future sales? Which employees are at risk of leaving the company in the next year?
By applying predictive analytics techniques such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and data mining, organizations can gain insights into potential future trends and behaviors, allowing them to make proactive decisions and strategies based on anticipated outcomes.
   
5. **Prescriptive Analytics** : “What should we do next?” - What is the best pricing strategy to maximize profits while maintaining customer satisfaction? How can we optimize our supply chain to minimize costs and reduce delivery times? Which combination of marketing channels and messaging will most effectively convert leads into customers?

Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes by providing specific recommendations for action. By leveraging advanced modeling and optimization techniques, organizations can use prescriptive analytics to make data-driven decisions that lead to improved performance and efficiency.
